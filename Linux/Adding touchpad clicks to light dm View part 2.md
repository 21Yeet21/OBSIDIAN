# part 1:

To make the touchpad work with touch gestures or taps in LightDM as it does in GDM3, you can follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Check the Input Driver**

Ensure you have the correct input driver installed for your touchpad. Most modern systems use `libinput`. You can verify this by running:

```bash
grep -i "Using input driver" /var/log/Xorg.0.log
```

Look for entries mentioning `libinput`.

### **Step 2: Configure Touchpad for LightDM**

1. **Create or edit the LightDM configuration for input settings:** Open or create a file in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
    sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf
    ```
    
2. **Add a configuration section for your touchpad:** Add the following snippet:
    
    ```plaintext
    Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
    EndSection
    ```
    
    This enables touch tapping and natural scrolling.
    
3. **Save and exit the file.**
    

### **Step 3: Restart LightDM**

Restart the LightDM service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lightdm
```

### **Step 4: i did not  do this : Test and Adjust**

If tapping still doesnâ€™t work, ensure the touchpad is recognized and try checking the settings using `xinput`:

```bash
xinput list
```

Find your touchpad ID and enable tapping:

```bash
xinput set-prop <touchpad-id> "libinput Tapping Enabled" 1
```

Replace `<touchpad-id>` with the actual ID of your touchpad.

### **Optional: Enable Synaptics (if needed)**

If you use the Synaptics driver instead of `libinput`, install it:

```bash
sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
```

Then configure it similarly in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.

Yes, your approach is correct, but there are a few important steps to ensure that the `touchpad-setup.sh` script is properly executed by LightDM and that the script itself applies the desired settings. Here's how you can implement it:

### **Step 1: Modify LightDM Configuration**

Edit your LightDM configuration file (usually located at `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`) and include the `greeter-setup-script` option as shown:

```plaintext
[Seat:*]
greeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/touchpad-setup.sh

# Uncomment or modify other settings as needed
#type=local
#pam-service=lightdm
#pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin
#pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter
#xserver-command=X
#xmir-command=Xmir
```

This tells LightDM to execute the specified script before starting the greeter.

---

### **Step 2: Create the `touchpad-setup.sh` Script**

1. Create the script file at the specified location:
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /usr/bin/touchpad-setup.sh
    ```
    
2. Add the following content to enable touchpad tapping:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Enable tapping for the touchpad
    xinput set-prop "Your Touchpad Device Name" "libinput Tapping Enabled" 1
    xinput set-prop "Your Touchpad Device Name" "libinput Natural Scrolling Enabled" 1
    ```
    
    
    
    Replace `"Your Touchpad Device Name"` with the exact name of your touchpad device. You can find it by running:



    ```bash
    xinput list
    ```
    
3. Save and close the file.

### **Step 3: Make the Script Executable**

Set the correct permissions for the script:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/touchpad-setup.sh
```

---

### **Step 4: Restart LightDM**

Restart LightDM to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lightdm
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify the Setup**

After the LightDM greeter loads, verify if tapping works on the touchpad. If it doesn't, double-check:

1. The touchpad device name in the script.
2. Whether the `xinput` properties are correct (you can test them manually using the `xinput` command in a terminal).

---

### **Additional Tips**

- If you're unsure of the exact property names or values, use `xinput list-props <device-id>` to list all available properties for your touchpad.
- Use `sudo journalctl -xe` to check LightDM logs for any errors related to the `greeter-setup-script`.

This setup should make your touchpad work as expected in LightDM. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
