Here's a concise summary of red team roles versus penetration testing:

# Key Differences from Penetration Testing
* Red teamers focus on testing detection and response capabilities
* Penetration testers aim to find multiple vulnerabilities across systems
* Red team assessments typically run longer (up to a month) and are done by external teams
* Best suited for organizations with mature security programs

# Core Red Team Responsibilities 
* Simulate threat actor tactics and techniques
* Test security controls and incident response procedures
* Maintain persistent access while avoiding detection
* Provide actionable insights to prevent real attacks

The key distinction is that while both roles test security, red teams specifically emulate real attackers to assess an organization's entire security program effectiveness, not just find vulnerabilities.
