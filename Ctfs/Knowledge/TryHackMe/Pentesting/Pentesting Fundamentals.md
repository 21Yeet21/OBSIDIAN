### What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing (pentesting) is an ethical process where security professionals identify vulnerabilities in a client's application or system by simulating potential attacks. The objective is to evaluate and enhance the security measures that protect assets and sensitive information.

#### Key Points:

- **Purpose of Pentesting**: To analyze and test security defenses, ensuring they can withstand malicious attacks.
- **Ethical Hacking**: Pentesting uses the same tools, techniques, and methodologies as attackers but within a legal and ethical framework.
- **Significance of Cybersecurity**:
    - Cybersecurity impacts everyone, from individuals securing their email accounts with strong passwords to businesses safeguarding sensitive data.
    - Cybersecurity breaches are increasingly common, with over 2,200 cyberattacks occurring daily—equivalent to one attack every 39 seconds (Source: _Security Magazine_).

### Penetration Testing Ethics

The ethical and legal aspects of penetration testing are critical to ensuring the integrity of the process. While terms like "hacking" often carry negative connotations, ethical penetration testing operates within defined legal frameworks and agreed-upon parameters.

#### Key Points:

1. **Legality of Penetration Testing**:
    
    - A penetration test is an authorized audit of a system's security, with clear agreements on scope and methods between the tester and the system owner.
    - Anything outside the agreed scope is deemed unauthorized and illegal.
    - Accreditation frameworks, such as the UK's NCSC CHECK scheme, ensure that companies conducting penetration tests meet legal and professional standards.
2. **Ethical Challenges**:
    
    - Legal actions during a test may raise ethical questions (e.g., accessing sensitive data or testing employees via phishing attacks).
    - Ethics involve moral judgment, and what is legal may not always align with personal beliefs of right and wrong.
3. **Hacker Categories**:
    
    - **White Hat**: Ethical hackers operating within the law to improve security (e.g., penetration testers).
    - **Grey Hat**: Individuals who may benefit others but don't always adhere to the law or ethical standards (e.g., taking down scam sites without permission).
    - **Black Hat**: Malicious hackers seeking personal gain or to harm others (e.g., ransomware creators).

#### Rules of Engagement (ROE):

The ROE outlines how penetration testing engagements are conducted, including:

- **Permission**: Explicit legal authorization for the engagement.
- **Test Scope**: Specific targets for testing (e.g., certain servers or applications).
- **Rules**: Permitted techniques (e.g., whether phishing or MITM attacks are allowed).

#### Answers to the Questions:

1. **Given permission to perform a security audit**: You would be a **White Hat** hacker.
2. **Attacking an organization and stealing data**: You would be a **Black Hat** hacker.
3. **Document defining the engagement**: The **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** document.




### Penetration Testing Methodologies

Penetration testing methodologies define the structured approach a tester follows during an engagement. While objectives and targets vary, the general methodology includes the following **stages**:

#### Penetration Testing Stages:

1. **Information Gathering**:
    - Collect publicly accessible information (e.g., OSINT, research).
    - No active scanning of systems is performed here.
2. **Enumeration/Scanning**:
    - Discover applications and services running on target systems (e.g., web servers).
3. **Exploitation**:
    - Leverage identified vulnerabilities using public exploits or custom techniques.
4. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - Expand access vertically (e.g., user to admin) or horizontally (e.g., user to another user).
5. **Post-Exploitation**:
    - Pivot to other hosts, gather more data, cover tracks, and prepare the final report.

- **Focus**: Telecommunications, wired/wireless networks, and communication systems.
- **Advantages**:
    - Comprehensive and adaptable.
    - Sets universal standards for systems and applications.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Complex and highly detailed.
    - Uses unique definitions that can be challenging to understand.

#### 2. **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)**:

- **Focus**: Web applications and services.
- **Advantages**:
    - Easy to learn and frequently updated.
    - Covers all stages from testing to reporting.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Limited to web application testing.
    - Lacks official accreditation like CHECK.

#### 3. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1**:

- **Focus**: Security controls and risk management for critical infrastructure and commercial organizations.
- **Advantages**:
    - Widely adopted (used by ~50% of American organizations by 2020).
    - Extremely detailed and frequently updated.
    - Provides accreditation and complements other frameworks.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Lacks strong auditing policies.
    - Limited focus on cloud computing.

#### 4. **NCSC CAF (Cyber Assessment Framework)**:

- **Focus**: Risk assessment for critical services like infrastructure and banking.
- **Advantages**:
    - Backed by government agencies.
    - Includes accreditation and covers 14 security principles.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Relatively new; organizations may need more time to adapt.
    - Based on principles, not direct rules.

### Summary: Penetration Testing Process

The penetration testing process involves six key stages, each with distinct objectives and tasks to ensure a thorough evaluation of a system's security. Here's an overview:

---

#### **1. Rules of Engagement**

This stage sets the foundation for an ethical and legal penetration test.

- **Permission**: Both parties sign a document granting clear permission for the activities.
- **Test Scope**: Defines specific targets or environments to be tested (e.g., part of an application, not the entire network).
- **Rules**: Outlines acceptable behaviors and restrictions for the tester (e.g., accessing only specific parts of a system).

---

#### **2. Information Gathering**

Collect publicly accessible data about the target to build a complete picture.

- Example: Social media profiles, email addresses, and network information.
- Goal: Identify user accounts, machines, applications, and other relevant intel.

---

#### **3. Enumeration**

Discover services, applications, and vulnerabilities within the defined scope.

- Example: Scanning ACME's web server IP (e.g., “96.37.50.151”) for open ports and potential weaknesses.
- Importance: Findings in this phase guide the exploitation stage.

---

#### **4. Exploitation**

Leverage vulnerabilities identified in the enumeration phase to gain unauthorized access.

- Example: Exploiting a vulnerability in ACME’s website to hack into the system ethically.
- Purpose: Demonstrate the real-world risks associated with security gaps.

---

#### **5. Post-Exploitation**

Focus on maintaining access and escalating privileges.

- **Privilege Escalation**: Gain access to higher-privileged accounts (e.g., administrator).
- **Lateral Movement**: Target other systems or extract sensitive data from the compromised environment.

---

#### **6. Reporting and Cleanup**

Document findings and ensure no residual impact on the client’s environment.

- **Pentest Report**: Provide a detailed explanation of vulnerabilities and mitigation recommendations.
- **Cleanup**: Remove artefacts and tools used during the engagement.

This structured approach ensures that penetration tests are thorough, ethical, and valuable for improving security.
