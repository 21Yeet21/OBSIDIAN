Got it! Here's a shorter version with all the key points:

---

## **Task 1: Introduction**  

### **What Are Regex?**  
Regex are text patterns used to search and match specific content in documents.  

---

### **Why Learn Regex?**  
- Saves time by automating searches.  
- Useful for CTFs and development.  

---

### **How to Test Regex**  
1. **Local**: Use `egrep <pattern> <file>` on a text file.  
2. **Online**: Use tools like [Regexr](https://regexr.com/).  

**Tip**: Online tools like Regexr are easier for beginners.

Hereâ€™s a concise summary for **Task 2: Charsets**:

---

## **Task 2: Charsets**  

### **What Are Charsets?**  
Charsets match specific characters or ranges using `[ ]`.  
- Example: `[abc]` matches `a`, `b`, or `c`.  

---

### **Using Ranges**  
- `[a-c]` matches `a`, `b`, or `c`.  
- Combine ranges: `[a-cx-z]` matches `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, or `z`.  

---

### **Special Cases**  
- Match any letter: `[a-zA-Z]`.  
- Match numbers: `file[1-3]` matches `file1`, `file2`, `file3`.  
- Exclude characters: `[^k]ing` matches `ring`, `sing`, but not `king`.  

---

### **Key Notes**  
1. Charsets match individual characters, not the exact string.  
2. Be specific but not overly complicated.  
3. The most efficient regex is preferred.  

---

### **Practice Questions**  
1. Match: `c`, `o`, `g`.   **Answer**: `[cog]`
2. Match: `cat`, `fat`, `hat`.   **Answer**: `[cfh]at`
3. Match: `Cat`, `cat`, `Hat`, `hat`. **Answer**  \[CcHh]at
4. Match: `File1`, `File2`, `file3`, `file4`, `file5`, `File7`, `file9`.  **Answer**\[Ff]ile\[1-9] 
5. Match all filenames from Q4 except `File7`. **Answer** \[Ff]ile\[^7] 

---

## **Task 3: Wildcards and Optional Characters**  

### **Wildcard (`.`)**  
- Matches any single character except a line break.  
- Example: `a.c` matches `aac`, `abc`, `a0c`, etc.  

---

### **Optional Character (`?`)**  
- Makes the preceding character optional.  
- Example: `abc?` matches `ab` and `abc`.  

---

### **Escaping Special Characters**  
- Use `\` to escape special characters like `.`.  
- Example: `a\.c` matches `a.c` but not `abc`.  

---

### **Practice Questions**  
1. Match: `Cat`, `fat`, `hat`, `rat`.    :  .at
2. Match: `Cat`, `cats`. : \[Cc]ats?  
3. Match: `cat.xyz`.  :  cat\\.xyz
4. Match: `cat.xyz`, `cats.xyz`, `hats.xyz`.  : \[ch]ats?\\.xyz
5. Match every 4-letter string not ending in `n-z`.  :  ...\[^n-z]
6. Match: `bat`, `bats`, `hat`, `hats` (exclude `rat`, `rats`). : \[^r]ats?

Let me know if you'd like me to continue with the next tasks! ðŸ˜ŠHereâ€™s the structured summary for **Task 4: Metacharacters and Repetitions**, followed by the questions and answers:

---

## **Task 4: Metacharacters and Repetitions**  

### **Metacharacters**  
- `\d`: Matches any digit (e.g., `9`).  
- `\D`: Matches any non-digit (e.g., `A`, `@`).  
- `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (e.g., `a`, `3`, `_`).  
- `\W`: Matches any non-alphanumeric character (e.g., `!`, `#`).  
- `\s`: Matches whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks).  
- `\S`: Matches non-whitespace (alphanumeric characters and symbols).  

Note: Underscores `_` are included in the `\w` metacharacter and not in `\W`. That means that `\w` will match every single character in `test_file`.

---

### **Repetitions**  
- `{n}`: Matches exactly `n` times (e.g., `z{2}` matches `zz`).  
- `{n,m}`: Matches between `n` and `m` times (e.g., `a{1,3}` matches `a`, `aa`, `aaa`).  
- `{n,}`: Matches `n` or more times (e.g., `b{2,}` matches `bb`, `bbb`, etc.).  
- `*`: Matches 0 or more times.  
- `+`: Matches 1 or more times.
