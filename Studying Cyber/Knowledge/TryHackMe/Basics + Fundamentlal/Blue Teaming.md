# ==Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview==


## Definition
A SOC consists of cybersecurity professionals who monitor networks and systems to detect malicious security events.

## Key Focus Areas
* **Vulnerabilities**
  SOC monitors system weaknesses and ensures proper patches are applied, implementing protective measures when fixes aren't available

* **Policy Violations**
  Monitors compliance with security rules, such as preventing unauthorized sharing of confidential company data

* **Unauthorized Activity**
  Detects and blocks compromised credentials and account misuse before damage escalates

* **Network Intrusions**
  Provides rapid detection of security breaches, whether from phishing links or server exploits, to minimize impact

The SOC's work encompasses various security tasks, including threat intelligence, to maintain comprehensive network protection.


Here's a comprehensive summary:

# ==Threat Intelligence==

## Core Concepts
- Intelligence: Information about actual/potential enemies
- Threat: Actions that can disrupt/harm systems
- Goal: Achieve threat-informed defense through data collection and analysis

## Intelligence Process
- Data Collection: From local sources (network logs) and public sources (forums)
- Data Processing: Organizing for analysis
- Analysis: Identify attackers, motives, and create action plans
- Outcome: Identify threat actors, predict activities, prepare responses

# ==Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)==

## Digital Forensics Areas
- File System Analysis: Examines storage images for programs, files, deleted content
- System Memory Analysis: Examines memory for malicious programs
- System Logs: Documents system activities and traces
- Network Logs: Monitors network traffic for attack indicators

## Incident Response Process
1. Preparation
   - Trained team readiness
   - Preventive measures implementation

2. Detection and Analysis
   - Incident monitoring
   - Severity assessment

3. Containment, Eradication, Recovery
   - Stop incident spread
   - Remove threats
   - Restore affected systems

4. Post-Incident Activities
   - Report generation
   - Lessons learned documentation
   - Prevention strategy updates


# ==Malware Overview==

## Definition
- Malware = Malicious Software
- Includes programs, documents, and files that can be saved or transmitted

## Common Types

### Virus
- Self-attaching code that spreads between computers
- Effects:
  - Alters, overwrites, deletes files
  - Causes system slowdown to complete failure

### Trojan Horse
- Appears legitimate but contains hidden malicious functions
- Example: Fake video player providing attacker system access

### Ransomware
- Encrypts user files making them unreadable
- Demands payment (ransom) for decryption password
