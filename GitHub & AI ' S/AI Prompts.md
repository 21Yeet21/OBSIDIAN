**Prompt Template:**

"Write a summary for [Task/Module Name] with the following structure:

1. Use **H2 headers** for the main task name (e.g., `## Task X: [Task Name]`).
    
2. Use **H3 headers** for subtopics (e.g., `### Subtopic`).
    
3. Keep explanations **concise but detailed**—aim for 2-4 sentences per subtopic.
    
4. Include **key points, examples, and commands** where relevant.
    
5. **Q&A Section**:
    
    - If questions are provided, answer them in a clear, bullet-point format.
        
    - If no questions are provided, generate up to five questions related to the topic and provide answers for them.
        
6. Use **markdown formatting** for code snippets (e.g., ` ```bash ` for commands).
7. Always put list of flags in tables
