# Task 12 Scoping and Targeting

Finally, we come to one of the most important aspects of using the Burp Proxy: **Scoping**.

Capturing and logging all of the traffic can quickly become overwhelming and inconvenient, especially when we only want to focus on specific web applications. This is where scoping comes in.

By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the `**Target**` tab, right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting `**Add To Scope**`. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select `yes`.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*AHdpbObFkr0sPnQi.gif)

To check our scope, we can switch to the **Scope settings** sub-tab within the **Target** tab.

The Scope settings window allows us to control our target scope by including or excluding domains/IPs. This section is powerful and worth spending time getting familiar with.

However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we need to go to the **Proxy settings** sub-tab and select `**And**` `**URL**` `**Is in target scope**` from the "Intercept Client Requests" section.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*L66SahcEfOdXhmrw.png)

Enabling this option ensures that the proxy completely ignores any traffic that is not within the defined scope, resulting in a cleaner traffic view in Burp Suite.

Answer the questions below

Add `**http://MACHINE_IP/**` to your scope and change the proxy settings to only intercept traffic to in-scope targets.

See the difference between the amount of traffic getting caught by the proxy before and after limiting the scope.

**Note:** The AttackBox is already configured to solve the problem posed in this task. If you use the AttackBox and don‚Äôt wish to read through the information here, you can skip to the next task.

When intercepting HTTP traffic, we may encounter an issue when navigating to sites with TLS enabled. For example, when accessing a site like `**https://google.com**/`, we may receive an error indicating that the PortSwigger Certificate Authority (CA) is not authorised to secure the connection. This happens because the browser does not trust the certificate presented by Burp Suite.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*7TI44MHuGRjqtLrB.png)

To overcome this issue, we can manually add the PortSwigger CA certificate to our browser‚Äôs list of trusted certificate authorities. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. **Download the CA Certificate:** With the Burp Proxy activated, navigate to [**http://burp/cert**.](http://burp/cert.) This will download a file called `**cacert.der**`. Save this file somewhere on your machine.
2. **Access Firefox Certificate Settings:** Type `**about:preferences**` into your Firefox URL bar and press **Enter**. This will take you to the Firefox settings page. Search the page for "certificates" and click on the **View Certificates** button.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*09XYeqdahtVbtbgq.png)

1. **Import the CA Certificate:** In the Certificate Manager window, click on the **Import** button. Select the `**cacert.der**` file that you downloaded in the previous step.
2. **Set Trust for the CA Certificate:** In the subsequent window that appears, check the box that says ‚ÄúTrust this CA to identify websites‚Äù and click OK.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:678/0*KvEbF4Qcd4yUGOMC.png)

By completing these steps, we have added the PortSwigger CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities. Now, we should be able to visit any TLS-enabled site without encountering the certificate error.

You can watch the following video for a visual demonstration of the full certificate import process:

By following these instructions, you can ensure that your browser trusts the PortSwigger CA certificate and securely communicates with TLS-enabled websites through the Burp Suite Proxy.

Answer the questions below

**If you are not using the AttackBox, configure Firefox (or your browser of choice) to accept the PortSwigger CA certificate for TLS communication through the Burp Proxy.**
